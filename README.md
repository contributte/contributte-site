## Info

This repository contains more websites at once.

The main **contributte** is based on [VuePress 1.x](https://v1.vuepress.vuejs.org/). VuePress is static site (documentation) generator.
Because we're lazy programmers, we reuse existing docs pages from the single repositories in [Contributte](https://github.com/contributte), [Nettrine](https://github.com/nettrine) and [Ninjify](https://github.com/ninjify) organization.

There is a template file for the README files which is used in generation phase. The resulting website contains about 150 pages (readmes) melted together.

## Data
